# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: I would use the method super() to call functions on a parent object. 

  Researched answer: The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.


2. What is a virtual DOM?

  Your answer: A virtual DOM is a blueprint of the real DOM.

  Researched answer:  The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.



3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to display "Hello World" in the browser?

  Your answer: a function and a return

  Researched answer: class, render, and return
 


4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: JSX allows us to write HTML in React. It's a combination between JavaScript and HTML

  Researched answer: SX is JavaScript flavored HTML that behaves almost like HTML with a couple small exceptions -- most notably JSX uses the syntax className rather than HTML's class because class is reserved for HTML.



5. What is state in React?

  Your answer: State is something that stores components.

  Researched answer: State is an object that stores a component's dynamic data and determines how the component renders and behaves.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Moving something to the top of the script. 
  Researched answer:
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).





## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React lifecycle methods:
You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.

Every component in React goes through a lifecycle of events. I like to think of them as going through a cycle of birth, growth, and death.

Mounting – Birth of your component
Update – Growth of your component
Unmount – Death of your component

- React props: Props are arguments passed into React components.

Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

- event.preventDefault(): The Event interface's preventDefault() method tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as it normally would be. The event continues to propagate as usual, unless one of its event listeners calls stopPropagation() or stopImmediatePropagation(), either of which terminates propagation at once.

- DOM events: DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.
- MVC: ands for "Model-View-Controller." MVC is an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts. They include the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle input).
